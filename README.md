# Task_3
This project implements both simple and multiple linear regression techniques to predict house prices based on features like area, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. The model is built using scikit-learn, with data preprocessing and visualization handled by pandas and matplotlib. I imported and preprocessed the dataset (handling missing values, selecting features)and then split the data into training and testing sets.Then trained a Linear Regression model to fit the data and evaluated the model performance using MAE, MSE, and RÂ² score.I also wrote a code that visualized actual vs predicted prices and finally I
interpreted the model coefficients to understand feature impact on pricing.
